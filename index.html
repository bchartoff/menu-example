			I wrote this in one line, but to break it down:
			1. 	data.filter is a JS built in function which takes an array and returns
				a filtered copy of it, based on certain criteria.
				See more info here:

				https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter

				Note that MDN is a great resource for JS, HTML, and CSS documentation (for vanilla JS)

			2.	Filter works by looking at every element in an array, and seeing if it matches your criteria.
				So an identical way to write this would be:

				let stateDatum = data.filter(function(s){
					return s.state == state
				})[0]

				We're checking if the `state` property of each datum in the array is equal to the `state`
				variable that was passed as a parameter to `getRank()`
			3. 	Since `filter` returns an array (in this case an array of length 1), we need to grab the first
				element of the array, hence the `[0]`
		*/
		let stateDatum = data.filter(s => s.state == state)[0]
		/*
			Once we've grabbed the datum, use the `category` variable which was passed in
			as a string to get the relevant rank. So if category is "health", we return
			stateDatum["healthRank"].

			Could have this whole function in one line as
			`return data.filter(s => s.state == state)[0][category + "Rank"]`
			but I thought that wasn't the nicest looking
		*/ 
		return stateDatum[category + "Rank"]
	}
	/*
		Two `getter` functions. When you call `getRank`, you need two values
		(`state` and `category`). One of those two values will be provided
		within the event handler for the related dropdown menu, but you'll
		need to grab the other value from the current status of the other dropdown

		Use jQuery to change the text inside the `rankLabel` span
		I believe your prototype had "1st" "2nd" "3rd" etc text, which
		you can handle the logic for in this function if you'd like
